# Input challenge

Link: [input challenge app on gh-pages](https://t-pyrope.github.io/input-challenge/)

This app is created via [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). It dynamically addes inputs on the page.

It's my solution to a test assignment from [Inventoro](https://inventoro.com/)
